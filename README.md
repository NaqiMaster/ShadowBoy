# Shadow Boy – 2D Platformer Game (C#)

## Overview
Shadow Boy is a single-player 2D platformer game developed in C#. The game focuses on player movement, collision detection, and puzzle-inspired level mechanics. This project was built to practice core game development concepts and object-oriented design in a structured codebase.

## Features
- 2D platformer gameplay with a single controllable character
- Player movement, jumping, and collision detection
- Level logic and basic puzzle-style mechanics
- Animation state transitions based on player actions
- Clean object-oriented architecture for maintainability

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** C#
- **Tools:** MonoGame
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming, Game Loops, Collision Detection, State Management

## How It Works
- The game runs using a real-time update loop
- Player input drives movement and state transitions
- Collision logic handles interactions with the environment
- Animation states change based on player actions (idle, moving, jumping)

## Purpose
This project was created to:
- Apply object-oriented programming in a larger codebase
- Understand real-time game loops and input handling
- Practice collision detection and state-based animation
- Build a complete, playable game from scratch

## Notes
- This project emphasizes gameplay logic and structure over visual polish
- Designed as a learning project to strengthen core programming skills
